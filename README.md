# Project Philosophy: 

Quicky is a Job Board application for quick gigs. This application was inspired by my own life, specifically during my time at Flatiron School where I have been working freelance as a means to dedicate the majority of my time to learning instead of having to commit to a job. I often post on istagram when I am looking for quick PA work, or audio engineering work when I need extra money and thought there should be someone where artists and creatives could post.

# Features:

- The home page displays a description of the application, and instructs the user to click on the "Listings" link in the navigation in order to view all of the listings
- Upon clicking on "Listings" in the navigation there is a dropdown menu at the top of the page to allow you to sort the listings by category
- Below the dropdown menu is a form where users can create new categories
- Below the form is all of the listings which are displayed with a title, body, and category and have the ability to be edited as well as deleted
- If you would like to create a new listing click "New Listing" in the navigation which will take you to a form to fill out
- Once you are done filling out the form click "Create Listing" which will automatically take you to the "listings" page where you can see your new listing that you created
